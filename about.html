                    <h2>About Us</h2>
                    <p>
                       Renowned industrialist and philanthropist Dr Karsanbhai K Patel, the founder of the Nirma Group of Industries, established the Nirma Education and Research Foundation (NERF) in the year 1994 with a vision to promote higher education and provide excellent educational facilities to the youth in India. In 1995, Nirma Institute of Technology – affiliated to Gujarat University – was established by the NERF. It was followed by the establishment of Nirma Institute of Management in 1996.
                       <br>
                        In the year 2003, the Government of Gujarat approved the proposal of the NERF to found the Nirma University, Ahmedabad. Hence, the Nirma University was established under a special Act passed by the Gujarat State Legislative Assembly. The University Grants Commission (UGC) duly recognised the University under the Section 2 (f) of the UGC Act.
                        <br>
                        The NERF is equally committed to school education. It strongly believes in the fact that a strong foundation is a prerequisite for education. With this philosophy, it runs two schools ‘Nirma Vidyavihar’ at Bodakdev and Chharodi in Ahmedabad, where the emphasis is laid on to provide value-based education clubbed up with innovative educational practices.
